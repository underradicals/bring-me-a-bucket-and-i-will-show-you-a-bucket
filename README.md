# Digital Clock

DC may seem like a silly little app on the surface. But it is actually a little more complicated that what meets the eye. Each number is made up of little spans, together 120+ after it is all said and done. The logic is simple, but I did take some care to make it as efficient as possible by minimizing the amount of renders done per tick/second.
